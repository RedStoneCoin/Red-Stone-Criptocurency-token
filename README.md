# RedStone Multi Blockhain Protocol

## How it will work?
Redstone Protocl is a network made of peer-to-peer parallel blockchains, Redstone achieves the best scalability that was ever made via a sharded setup. For our implementation of sharding, a transaction will be sent by a user, to the chain with the least amount of pending transactions.There will be three or more chains because transactions will go through smoother and fasterthan with one, therefore reducing transaction times, every block in every chain will have themiracle root of the previous block from all chains there, thereby securing the whole network.
Please note this is currently still a thesis and NOT a tested system, if you have any ideas or concerns please open an issue.
